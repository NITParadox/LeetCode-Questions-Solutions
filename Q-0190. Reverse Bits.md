# _leetCode_ Question: [190. Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

**Note**:

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.

- **It is absolutlly not Optimised, but it is the brut force approch i have come up with..**

## JAVA code:

<br>

    import java.math.BigInteger; // must import it to use BigInteger.
    class Solution {
            public int reverseBits(int n) {
            StringBuilder a = new StringBuilder();
            a.append(Integer.toBinaryString(n));
            a.reverse();
            while (32 - a.length() > 0){
                a.append(0);
            }

            return new BigInteger(a.toString(), 2).intValue();
        }
    }

# Question: [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array nums. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` _after placing the final result in the first `k` slots of `nums`_.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory**.

## JAVA code:

```JAVA
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int k = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[k] == nums[i]) {
                continue;
            } else {
                nums[++k] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return k + 1;
    }
}
```

# _leetCode_ Question: [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a **linear** runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

## Aproch

- The trick is here the XOR operator, we know a ^ a = 0 and x ^ 0 = x;
- if every element is comming twice in the array, XOR of all element will be zero
- and if there is nay number that dosn't occure twice itt will remain at last.

* ## Time complexity O(n)

## JAVA code:

<br>

    class Solution {
            public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
            int ans = nums[0];
            for(int i = 1; i < nums.length ; i++){
                ans ^= nums[i];
            }
            return ans;
        }
    }

### If the array was sorted, the then we will apply binary search,

# _leetCode_ Question: [455. Assign Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/)

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child `i` has a greed factor `g[i]`, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie `j` has a size `s[j]`. If `s[j] >= g[i]`, we can assign the cookie `j` to the child `i`, and the child `i` will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

## Approch:

- sort both the arrays;
- use two pointer
  - if current cookie is equal or greater than require count++;
  - else go to the next cookie

## JAVA code:

```
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int countContent = 0;
        while (i < g.length && j < s.length) {
            if (g[i] <= s[j++]) {
                ++countContent;
                ++i;
            }
        }

        return countContent;
    }
}
```
